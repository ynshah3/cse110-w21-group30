This is the third version of PomoHero, a web application to help users implement the Pomodoro Technique and find themselves master time management and focus undistractedly on their tasks.

With having implemented all of the major features that had been planned, and with the coming of the end the project lifecycle, we have polished some of the existing features in order to bring to you a better experience.

This version will see the incorporation of error messages in order to assist users to know why certain buttons have been disabled at certain times. Colors have been assisted with text in order to make our app accessible for color-blind persons. Keeping the user flow in mind, we have decided to turn our instructions into a modal popup which will not be accessible during breaks so that the user has as least of distraction as possible.

Animations have been added to the task list and instructions box to counter a monotonous app experience. Remaining time can be seen in the titlebar which allows the user to minimize the tab and work on other tabs.

Overall, this version brings an experience which keeps in mind the wants of the user and offers a seamless and hopefully flawless interaction.
