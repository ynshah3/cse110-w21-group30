This is the very first version of PomoHero, a web application to help users implement the Pomodoro Technique and find themselves master time management and focus undistractedly on their tasks.

Being our Minimum Viable Product (MVP), it contains all of the most basic features that you as a user would need to succeed in your tasks with flying colors.

With features like a self-working timer, an option to end your working session, a way to take small refreshment breaks between individual Pomodoros, and to enjoy a long break after having given your complete focus to your tasks for two hours straight as a reward.
"But what if I am immersed in my work and don't know when to stop?". Don't worry, we have got you covered. You will get notification pings when it is time to enjoy a break (do not forget to enable notifications!).

Do keep in mind that our web application will not allow to, and even force you (in a good way) to not get distracted while working. If you do get distracted, fret not. There is a reset button to restart your current Pomodoro.
This encourages you to not just pause and play the timer whenever you feel like, and it is a way of punishing you by making you work again for the time that you did spend working before getting distracted.
