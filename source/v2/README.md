This is the second version of PomoHero, a web application to help users implement the Pomodoro Technique and find themselves master time management and focus undistractedly on their tasks.

With our users wanting an embedded tasklist functionality within the app in order to not have to use external tools to track their work, we have decided to add a tasklist feature.
This feature will allow users to add all of their tasks before they start their session so that they can keep track of which tasks have been completed and which tasks still remain.
The tasklist functionality follows the CRUD pattern : Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This means that tasks can be added, edited, deleted, as well as seen within the app.

Moreover, we have also given users the ability to change the theme of the app since this will allow them to work peacefully under a theme of their preference.
There will be two themes to choose from - first, a theme which uses only warm and cool colors to bring a colorful yet calming experience to the user, and second, 
a theme which uses an image of nature since nature is known to remove all negative emotions from the mind and body.

Finally, we have also fixed how our app responds to screen resizing. We have made our app more responsive by adding media queries so that ultimately, even mobile devices can support it.

Hope you like the refined look and the incorporation of some amazing features,
