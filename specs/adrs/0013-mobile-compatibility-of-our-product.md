# Mobile Compatibility of our Product

## Context and Problem Statement

Is it worth designing our product to also be mobile compatible?

## Considered Options

* No - The extra development and design work to make it mobile responsive might be too much for the limited time we have.  
* Yes - Gives users option to use our product on mobile phones, making our product more accessible.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 'Yes', because

* Though we might need to put more effort to build our product, the accessibility of our products to the users will increase drastically. In the modern age, mobile phone usage has increased dramatically.
* Furthermore, users with no access to computers will also be able to use our product.
* It will also facilitate users that have a computer but will prefer to have the Pomodoro timer on the phone by their sides rather than on their main screen.
