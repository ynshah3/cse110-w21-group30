## Agenda
Team Status and Tasklist details

## New Business

**Tasks**:  
The team decided on showing the slide-out task list only before the user starts the session. This will be the only opprtunity for the user to add, edit, or delete tasks. Once the session has started, the task list button will be disabled. We thought of keeping a maximum limit for how many tasks a user can add at a time but then voted against such a rule.

**Button Functionality**:  
Each task will be an input field which the user can edit by simply clicking on the input field. There will be a central add button which adds tasks and a delete button next to each task.
