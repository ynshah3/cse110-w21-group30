# Sprint 3 Retrospective

For our retrospective, we used Retrium. Members of our team put forward what they thought went well in our Sprint 3 and what they thought could have been done better. 
We compiled all these thought to define the approach we will take for our next sprint i.e. the Last Sprint. These thoughts have been listed below.

## What went well, What could have been done better and the action plan we can take to do better

## What didn't go well & the corresponding Action Plan

#### Architectural Issues early in the Sprint made the Develepoment process harder:
Fortunately, this issue was contained in the early-mid stages of the Sprint. Some steps that we took to overcome this was: Met with our Mentor and Prof. Powell to discuss our developement architecture and took their advice of centralizing our code.

#### Not every feature is completely finished yet:
We were not able to complete some of the features that we were planning to finish in this sprint. We plan to finish them in Sprint 4 i.e. the last week sprint. These features are listed below

## Conclusion
Compared to our Sprint 2 retrospective meeting, the amount of things that well were far more and the amount of things that could have have been better were far less. The Action Plan that we decided on in the previous retrospective was effectively implemented, which bore fruit.
