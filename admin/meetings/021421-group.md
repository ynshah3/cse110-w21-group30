## Agenda
Discuss what to work on during the MVP sprint

## New Business

**Web app design**:  
A new motion was proposed by Muhammad Z Khan regarding the current design of our web app. They suggested that the design of our web app should look more modern. The buttons should be less rounded, the text color should be dark instead of plain white, there should not be any shadows since they become the focus of attention, thus distracting the user. Also, a clean and simplistic design was proposed. The team members weighted the pros and cons of changing the design at this stage of the sprint and unanimously passed the motion. Ivan Robles and Yash Shah will be working on new designs and be responsible for implementing the associated CSS functionality.
